# Playground
Playing around with C++ features that we learn in class.

## Resources
### Lambda Expressions
* [Using C++ Lambdas, University of Michigan](http://umich.edu/~eecs381/handouts/Lambda.pdf)
* [Lambda Expressions in C++, Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/lambda-expressions-in-cpp?view=vs-2019)

### Macros
* [C++ Preprocessor](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_preprocessor.htm)

### Misc.
* [C++11 Syntax Support (vim)](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/c-11-syntax-support): Without it, the C++11 features are treated as syntax errors in vim.
    * [Problems with Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim/issues/642)
